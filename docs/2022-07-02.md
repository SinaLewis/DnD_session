        -- acting as envoys to figure out why shipments of metals have stopped
        -- we were also asked to look into Mr. Dillygaffer---master craftsman for our dragonhide---and check that's he ok
    - Guards check our inventory, ask for our papers and reason for visiting
    - Guards hold onto our explosives and poisons

    - Eraphina and Iggy convinced them that they'd already checked them so they get to keep everything
    - Our presence draws the attention of most of the inn that we are waiting at
    - Something wrong with the town, they've closed the mines and theres a general miasma over the town
    - While trying to get to the mines a dwarf warns me off, saying they've closed it because there's "something something" dangerous
    - I use divine sense near the mines: within 60 ft of the entrance there is nothing
