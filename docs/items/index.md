## Cool Stuff

- Alchemists Fire

This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged Attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

- [Grenades](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/1Lb_PMFBNfk9gcj-JkzzGdZFWENkYe8yqLJ0pmtrNckTY)

Through meticulous preparation and careful work, you have created hand grenades. They are roughly tennis ball sized and fashioned out of a thin shell of cast iron. They detonate on impact, as a small vial of alchemist fire breaks, igniting the gunpowder inside. Worry not! You had the brains to install a safety pin, and they wonâ€™t explode willy nilly, at least you think. They have a range of 30/70ft. Choose a point within range. Each creature in a 10ft radius sphere must make a DC 15 dexterity saving throw. Taking 2d8 piercing and 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
