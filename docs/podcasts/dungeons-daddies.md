## Review by Sina

Beautiful, well-developed D&D podcast. Season 1 establishes a specific goal and, with many hijinks along the way, achieves it. Season 2 continues the hijinks and hilarity, perhaps with a less well-defined goal. This show was the first D&D podcast I listened to and really sparked my thirst for these podcasts as well as D&D.
