Episode 1 begins with Tum Darkblade (Tin Lanning), Thom the Dragonborn (Mike Bachmann), Junpei Iori (Steven Strom), and Aludra (Jennifer Cheek) who find themselves in a very strange situation (engineered by DM Michael DiMauro).

A side-story interlude hosted by guest DM Fred Greenleaf where 5 adventurers travel deep into a mysterious and unknown underground city, to explore and rescue a team of miners that have recently gone missing.

#### Campaign 2 (ongoing, 23 episodes)

This is a completely brand new campaign set within the world of Campaign 1. No knowledge of Campaign 1 is required to understand and enjoy this campaign, so it's a great place to jump in if you don't want to start a 400+ episode journey.

Episode 0 begins with a group of adventurers of some renown hearing tell of a dragon, a foe for more powerful than they have faced to date, ravaging the lands of House Cromwell. Being that they are as brave as they are heroic they set off to show this beast that you do not mess with the people of this land. And episode 1 continues when the siren call of fate pulls a group of stalwart individuals to the town called Rimeford. Surely this chance encounter will have long lasting ramifications on the realm.
