## Review by Sina

I was a little tentative about this podcast. At one point I started it and had trouble getting through the first episode because the brothers all sound the same and the first episode focuses on establishing the characters and how D&D works. But once you get through that, boy howdy! It's great! The first season is definitely the best, but the different worlds and stories that they build are all beautiful, inclusive, and a fun listen. I also think it's interesting how they don't stick to stricly D&D 5e, which really allows them to expand their worlds.
