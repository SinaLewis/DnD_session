## The Goblin Fight Continued

- We soundly defeated the goblins and sent some running
- One villager was left alive, the woman hanging from a hook. Rieta doesn't manage to remove her from the hook very delicately, but makes up for it by healing her for 3 times her max HP.
- The woman is a very interesting individual, perhaps in shock over the desctruction of her town or maybe just a psychopath. We escort her back to the remains of her village and then continue back to Dewfalls to report to Baron Yve.
- Baron Yve informs us that the tunnels connect to a fort(?) and he doesn't have the troops to spare to help us flush out the goblins who have probably set up there. We generously offer to help, for a price. Baron Yve, obviously believing we won't survive, offers us 10,000 GP if we handle it. We convince him to agree to a more reasonable sum that he'll actually be able to repay.

Some side notes
- Aurora's healing word is Jambalaya
- A healing potion is a bonus action
