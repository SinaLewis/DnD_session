## 

- Downtime activities
    - Rieta trains with Percival the Titan, leader of the nearby town and increases her Stre and Con score by 1
    - Pethani works on building a tavern on the road between the town and Dragonwater Keep
    - Aurora works as an herbalist
    - Iggy wants to start an inn/tavern situation, but ended up going with just an inn next to Pethani's tavern and also sowing rumors about us and our awesome fiefdom (tourism campaign). Our taxable population increased by 10
    - Eraphina is doing some sort of crime
- Ruling a fief
    - 40 (50 with Iggy's rumor spreading) people of taxable age in Dragonwater Hamlet (about 60 total)
    - They make about 240 gp / month, we can tax up to 12% of that with no penalty/problem
    - For each +5% that we add above 12%, we generate a riot point, which goes towards the risk that they'll riot and overthrow us
    - More details in the [document Otto put together](https://discord.com/channels/912857661484175390/913156972126277652/1084257697802760274)
    - We went with a nice 12% so there is wiggle room to go up or down
- Off to the underdark now! After we pick up Aurora and Iggy's (retcon that he had some made) dragonhide armour
- Gorrick is joining us, we (Sina) had forgetten that the council had arranged for him to tag along with us
- Heading into the underdark, Aurora makes sure that we don't get lost
- We reach a split where the tunnel heads east or west. Aurora pipes up that we should go west and Pethani says simultaneously that we should go east. Rieta proposes we spin a bottle to decide. The party heads west.
- Although Rieta is very NOT stealthy, the rest of the group makes up for it and we manage to dodge patrols of Duergar and Drow until we end up at a large cavern where we decide to make camp.
    - Aurora goes looking for mushrooms and doesn't do very well
    - Pethani makes food from the dragon meat we had instead and does so well that when we wake up we have 10 temp HP and lightning resistance until the next long rest
    - Eraphina does an amazing job hiding the camp
    - Rieta takes 1st watch, Gorrick takes 2nd, Iggy 3rd, and Pethani 4th (nothing happens)
- We continue west down the tunnel
    - Rieta is even more noisy, but Eraphina rescues the group with a clever use of mushrooms
- We arrive at a drow stronghold city
    - Aurora remembers that the bartender who gave us a lead on her lost love said that the dude was looking to convert drow to the surface dark elf god person
    - Rieta asks if we want to try and sneak in or avoid this place
    - Aurora sherlocks the heck out of the problem and deduces there is a high posibility that her boyfriend is indeed within the walls
- We enter the city
    - Rieta uses disguise self to look like a drow guard and brings in Pethani and Gorrick as 'prisoners'
    - Eraphina and Aurora plan to sneak in
    - Iggy has dissapeared somewhere
- Rieta has guards lead us to the prison (due to matriarchal drow society it's super easy)
- Eraphina and Aurora manage to sneak in invisibly
- Aurora isn't able to identify any of the prisoners as her boyfriend, but we decide to release them anyways to cause some good chaos
- We manage to release a good portion before guards who heard the commotion start arriving
