# And that's when everything went wrong

- After investigating the room where we fought the Hezrou and stuff, we find a ring of soot and the room smells faintly of rotting flesh and sulfer.
- Gorick Rimari says that he "reckon this is where the portal was"
- Pethani is able to tell that the soot is from a large portal
- The portal was likely connected to the ritual that we stopped and destroyed up above
- We go talk to the council and let them know what was going on down there
    - We ask for compensation but my 17 persuasion roll is apparently not enough for a non-conditional payment, they want us to sign an NDA
    - They threaten us and say that if we don't sign the NDA they'll throw us in jail
    - Aurora and I absolutely refuse and decide to leave
    - They prevent us from leaving and a fight starts
    - A chase sequence commences
    - We try to not kill them, but whoops, apparently they only have 11 HP
