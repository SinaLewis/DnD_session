## 
- We end up back near where we started in the fortress. We discover that the door immediately north opens into a room with jail cells.
- Within the cells are three figures. 2 are dead with various features partially transformed into that of a mindflayer. One is still breathing, but as Pethani turns them over it is revealed that their face has transformed. It grapples Pethani.
- Aurora manages to push the person away from Pethani and Pethani proceeds to knock them out.
- Aurora is able to discern that the potion they were holding in their hand seems to have stabilized the transformation.
- Pethani ends up killing them and we aren't able to get any more information.
- We continue into the room and discover a pile of bodies. The bodies are too decayed to really tell whether or not they were also victims of experimentation.
- Further in, we finally find Aurora's long lost love! He seems to be somewhat out of it and his eyes are yellow. Oddly, his cell was not locked.
- After Rieta touches his shoulder, the elf grabs her and says "IT MUST BE DESTROYED." Pethani failes to get the elf to disclose what exactly must be dstroyed. He mutters something about a wand. Rieta decides to focus on trying to get him out of this place, but he just mutters "not yet".
- We lock him up back in the cell to keep him safe as we look for this wand he mentioned. As we leave, however, we hear him shouting "oh no, it's gone, where has it gone?"
- We go running back to the cell and find him holding a brick he pulled from the wall and biting his nails. When questioned about what is missing, he just mutters "something that shouldn't exist"
- We decide to just leave the drow fortress with Aurora's long lost love and try to get him help.
- Back in the dwarven city, we take the elf to a healer. After some haggling, the healer casts Greater Restoration on the elf, which helps him slightly.
