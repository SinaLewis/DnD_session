## 

- We talk with Baron Yve/guards more about the fort the goblins have occupied. We decide the best course of action is to approach from the tunnels, stealthily.
- Except we are not stealthy.
- The goblins heard us coming and barricaded the tunnel to prevent our approach. Pethani cannonballs his way through the rubble, clearing a small path for everyone to follow.
- We make our way into a large room and encounter a gargantuan spider covered in goblins.
- The spider is revealed to actually be a Yochlol who seems to be pretty powerful. We do however manage to take her down, with Rieta doing some teleportation and grab shenanigans to get them off the pillar they were walking along the side of
- We gain 1520 XP and can level up!
