## 

- We (minus Pethani) return to update the townspeople and then Lady Gillstein
- We give one of the basilisk eggs to Lady Gillstein for testing
- While attempting to get more information out of Lady Gillstein, she pointed us in the direction of the Office of Historical Records
- Pethani stayed behind in the village to assist them with any tasks during this time
    - this seems to mainly take the form of begging the DM for a house
- Getting back to the others, we talk with a dusty old man with way too much to say
- We learn that we have a crest shaped like a round shield with the image of a sleeping stag
- We obtain a list of five names of renegade wizards that might have created the basilisk queen as research. Suprisingly, after consulting with the moruge, none of them have died yet (despite the paper being old)
- We then go to the wizard tower, where we learn from the gnome Roland that one is actually dead, but there are two we didn't know about
- Roland helpfully points out on the list Ophelia Necrolia, who recently endangered the lives of the spire by creating some super rabbit
    - he gives us a key to get into her room
    - we search her room and find... nothing, because Rieta and Aurora are not good detectives
- We name the village that we need to keep referencing, Dragonwater Hamlet
- Pethani arranges for the keep to be fixed up
- And we then enter into 2 weeks of downtime where we train and set up our new hamlet!
