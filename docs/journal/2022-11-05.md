## The End of The Quarks?

- Iggy appears to have gotten lost in a void during this session
- Aurora and Eraphina start their daring rescue mission to save the children
- Reita becomes impatient and figures that Aurora and Eraphia could use the distraction anyways. She attempts (and fails) to sneak up on some guards and battle commences.
- We really shouldn't have done this without Iggy
- Aurora dies
- Everyone else is on the brink of death
- How will the heroes escape this pickle?
- Rieta keeps trying to get Pethani up on his feet, but he keeps going back down.
- Rieta fought valiantly but evetually is also cut down by the ogre. When this happens, her body turns pitch black and she sees the vision she saw when she took the pitch black sword. A voice says that they can save her if she makes a deal. 
- Being raised by the Fey, Rieta knows not to make a deal without knowing the fine print. The being says that its thing is destruction. This worries Rieta since her thing is NOT destruction.
- Meta: Rieta gains a level in Warlock and (6d10+1d8) HP--her 6 hit dice from paladin and her 1 hit dice from Warlock.
- Rieta reawakens with her scales now have a black tint and are black on the edges. Her horns are now also tinged in black. She also now has the black sword in one hand and the radamite blade in the other.
- End here so Sina can figure out how to multiclass...
