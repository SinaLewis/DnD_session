## 

- We interrogate the drow priestess
    - How many people are in the citadel? A: ~2000
    - What is the purpose of the citadel?
- The priestess ends up having a seizure and dying
- In searching the room, we notice 2 statues of Lolth on the altar.
    - Rieta recalls her religion lessons and cautions against taking the statues
- In a bedroom behind the altar, Rieta finds a bunch (14) of papers written in undercommon
- South of the chapel room are various rooms that appear to be inhabited by acolytes of Lolth
    - In one, Rieta finds a book that is actually written in Common
    - When Pethani picks it up, he says it is written in his 'mother tongue' of Gnomish
    - Pethani gets the idea that by using mending we could possible get the book to think the notes we've found are part of it and the book would translate it
    - Aurora is able to cast mending!
- The note the duergar had in his hand
    - A list of duergar that the drow have taken captive. "If you have found this on my body, I have failed my mission. Please return this to Arundar Thunderhammer in the duergar settlement to the East"
- The priestess' notes
    - Pre-written sermons, diary entries...
    - An order from some arch-priestess that orders the drow priestess to be more careful when interacting with "those squid heads"
    - "current relationship with the illithid is not long for this world"
    - Iggy finds a 15th page that contains a letter of introduction introducting the priestess to Arundar Thunderhammer
    - Aurora realizes that this note is in preparation for the priestess to flee, beucase she worries that the arch-priestess has it out for her
- +13gp for the group
