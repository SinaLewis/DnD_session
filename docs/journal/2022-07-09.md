- Failed my perception check to figure out where the zombies came from (nat 1)
- Aurora tried and got a 10. She saw pickaxes and the dwarves appeared to be mining metal
- Pethani (with a 16) sees faint blood splotches coming from down a hallway. Presumably this is where the zombies came from.
- The hallway leads to a hole and a ladder to the next level
- Down the ladder

- Aurora gleans that undead creatures distort the space and cause supernatural phenomena
- We head off down the hallways
- I and Pethani sneak down a hallway and spy some zombies and a skeleton
-
