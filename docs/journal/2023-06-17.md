## 

- We leave the sewers and end up in the grove outside of the city, a little south of the entrance
- Before questioning the elves, we decide to head a little back towards the underdark exit and try and find somewhere safe(ish). But not all the way because it was (maybe) a 3 day trip.
- We find a grove of mushrooms that Eraphina identifies as fire-bloodshrooms (2d6 poison damage, but also 2d6 healing). They can be processed further to do solely poison/healing.
- Questioning the elves
    - How did they get here?
    Some were taken from their homes, others were down here preaching the light of the goddess Eilistraee
    - The ones who were preaching, do they know where Aurora's love (Aren Dhelei) went?
    The drow wanted to keep him in a more secure location due to him being on this 'secret' mission.
- We take a long rest (I give an inspirational speech) and we send the elven elders back to the surface as we continue to look for Aren
