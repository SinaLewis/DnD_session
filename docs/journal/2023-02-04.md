## The Basilisk Cave (part 2)

- We finish off the basilisks and Rieta becomes fully petrified
- That's okay though because we find some crates full of Greater Restoration potions
- Rieta is made unpetrified
- We find a ritual circle that we think, from the faded sigils, was
    - a new form of magic, from the school of transmutation magic
    - probably there to twist a creature into a mutated more powerful version of itself
- Pethani was able to re-write it and use it to give Rieta a 24-hour +4 buff to her strength
- We continued through the caves and found a basilisk queen
- We were able to defeat it, but not before Rieta turned to stone again
- Rieta finds on a dead villager
    - a pouch with 50 gold, half-plate, and a longsword
    - a letter signed by Geralt Wheatpot, who was on a quest to deal with wolves, that asks for their belongings to be returned to their family
- There's also a person who was turned to stone and then seems to have been smashed to pieces, as if the basilisks were feeding on it
- A fisherman with no identification (except an empty "hello my name is" tag)
- The basilisk queen's hide seems more thick and purpley
    - We try and take it so that someone who might know more can look at it
    - Pethani skins it perfectly and we obtain 75 lbs of flawless basilisk hide from the queen
- Pethani has 6 basilisk eggs from the hatchery area and we take one more from the area with the queen (for testing purposes). We smash the rest of them.
