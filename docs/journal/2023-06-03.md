title: D&D Session ??? - Jun. 03, 2023
---

## 

The last few sessions we have been working on escaping from the drow city by going through the sewers. Currently there are gates in our way that prevent us from getting beyond the city walls. Last time we fought 5 umber hulks and we found a lever that opened one of the gates between us and freedom.

-  We continue to explore the sewers looking for the other levers
- We find an alcove with two dead bodies, a human and a dwarf, and a rust monster about to chow down on a lever!
- We easily take out the rust monster and pull the lever, one more to go
- The human appears to have had their brain removed and the dwarf died due to psychic damage. Rieta and Pethani aren't sure what creature would have done such a thing. Sina and Andrew know its probably mindflayers, we are in the underdark after all
- We find the last lever, but too late. A rust monster munched on it. Pethani is unable to fix it with his tinkering tools, so Rieta suggests that we try blowing up the remaining gate
- Rieta has explosives from when they were in the mine earlier. Pethani calculates how much we need to hopefully open the gate without brining the sewer down on our heads and Rieta tries to set the explosives off with a fire bolt.
- The fire bolt misses and hits a gelatinous cube that just on the other side of the grate.
