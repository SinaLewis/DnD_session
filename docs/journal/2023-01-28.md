## The Basilisk Cave

- We left off last week about to fight some basilisks
- During the battle, Aurora comes close to being petrified, but at the last moment musters her strength and shrugs off the effect
- Rieta's comforting presence helps Pethani and Eraphina resist looking into the basilisk's eyes
- The party takes out 3 of the basilisks and the 4th runs away, which Rieta finds perfectly normal with a nat 1 (and -1 modifier) nature check
- Rieta proposes that they follow the basilisk that ran away and finds a hallway with multiple small rooms off of it
- In one of the rooms we find several small grey round-ish lumps, eggs!
- Something in the back of Rieta's mind says that something isn't right
- From the pamphelet the party had found earlier, Rieta remembers that basilisks are more solitary creatures and this setup seems more like a hive
- We go ahead and destroy the eggs since these basilisks don't seem to be part of the natural order anymore
- The basilisks, or something else?, remaining in the cave seems to have smelled the eggs as we smash them
- We retreat back the way we came and ready ourselves for a battle
    - Rieta spreads caltrops and oil at a few junctions and then casts bless on the front liners
    - The person sized mirror is placed between the group and the tunnel we just came from
    - Eraphina flies up to the ceiling and ties herself to a stalactite
- 5 basilisk emerge from the tunnel
    - Rieta's caltrop and oil trap slows down one of them
    - Rieta and Pethani use excellent AOE effects to deal massive damage to the other 4
    - Iggy finishes one off with a well placed Ray of Frost
    - The remaining 3 close to us sadly don't get tripped up by the mirror
    - We've finished off two of the five basilisks when another group arrives
- 6 more basilisks arrive
