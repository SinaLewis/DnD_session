## 

- We recover our bearings in the aftermath of the battle. Pethani realizes the goo left behing by the Yochlol can be useful as a reagent and collects some of it. We find 29 gold on the bodies of the goblins.
- The entire place has been desecrated by the goblins. Making it difficult for Rieta to pick out anything of note.
- The doors to the North reveal a long abandoned hall with dwarven skeletons. We decide to leave that area be for now
- Rieta suddenly notices the presence of Arnulf and decides to question him. The most they are able to get out of him is that he will fight with us on the orders of his mysterious master.
- Heading west out of the large hall where we fought the Yochlol, we eventually come upon a river flowing west.
- We follow the river as it flows and evetually come upon a camp of goblins. 
- It turns out that about 100 ft back, on the otherside of the river, there were a set of large double doors. (Silly Otto withholding important info)
- The fight with goblin camp is going slowly, but in our favor. When suddenly a rumbling starts shaking the earth and the goblins begin to flee.
