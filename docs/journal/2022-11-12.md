## The Battle Continues

- The DM prevented the party from being wiped out by the skin of his teeth. Will Rieta alone be enough to turn the tide of battle and allow the Quarks to survive?
- Things are immediately not going well as the mage casts magic missile on each turn, bypassing Rieta's excellent AC of 23
- The farmers arrived as reinforcements!
- ...and they immediately died.
- Eraphina succumbs to the blackness and dies
- Iggy pops back out of the void he had disappeared into
- We manage to survive the battle without any more losses
- Now how to revive Eraphina and Aurora... If they don't want to make a new character they have two options: resurection and reincarnation. Reincarnation costs 1000 gp and the herbalist is high enough level to be able to cast it. This method comes with the side effect of the person likely ending up as a different race. Resurection costs only 500 gp, but we don't know anyone who can cast such a spell.
- We forgot to roll to see if Erahpina's dragon heart exploded. After a few moments wrought with tension, in which Sophie was supposed to pick high or low and refused to commit, her corpse did NOT explode.
