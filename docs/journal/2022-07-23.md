## The Bloody Misadventure (AKA how Kylia came to be in the mines alone)

- We were hired by the city council to investigate disturbances within the mine (particularly the 3rd level). We were shown a secret entrance that leads directly to that level. 

- We immediately encountered a closed/locked gate with abjuration magic on it and three small sockets near it. Agron Qibin (Elizabeth) investigated and intuited that we should be able to find something that fits the sockets to open the gate.

- We found two round purple gems in empty rooms (one across a pit, another behind some boxes). We then found a church room with a third (blue, diamond shaped) gem. When we took it we were attacked by 3 demonic wraiths for 'desecrating the shrine'.

- After defeating the wraiths we continued on our journey. It turns out that one of the gems we found was indeed a duplicate that didn't work. We found the correct gem in a room with a couple of skeletons that we handily defeated.

- We went through the gate and a section of the mine collapsed, separating Kylia from the rest of the party. She had no way of knowing whether or not her remaining party members were alive.
