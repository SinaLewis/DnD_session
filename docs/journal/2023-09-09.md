## Fighting the Mindflayers

- We fight 4 mindflayers. It goes pretty well.
- Aurora and Rieta approach a murky pool in the center of the room. Aurora wonders aloud what would happen if we tossed a coin into the pool. Rieta offers to her a collapsing pole.
- As Aurora pokes the pool with the stick...we realize we aren't very perceptive. It's just some dirty water, moving on.
- We leave the room heading North, where we find an apparent torture room. On one of the racks is a human who has apparently had his brain extracted. On a table to the side are notes written in deep speech.
- Iggy is able to read it and reveals that it contains logs of experiments on countless beings. They appear to be trying to make humans with psychic powers thus making more powerful mindflayers when the subjects are turned. The purpose is to help the mindflayers with the attacks by githyanki on nearby mindflayer colonies.
- Pethani recalls that the githyanki used to be slaves of the mindflayers, freeing themselves after allying with Tiamat.
