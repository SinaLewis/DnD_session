## Mines

The party was sent to the Smoky Iron Mountains to determine why the shipments to Last Crest haven't been coming through. When they arrived they learned that there has been some sort of trouble in the Mines. After convincing the lord of the Smoky Iron Mountains to allow them to check out the mines, the party went down the gondola that leads to the front entrance and found themselves locked in the mines with no apparent way back out.
