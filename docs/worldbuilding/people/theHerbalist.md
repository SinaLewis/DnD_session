## The Herbalist

Located in the Bloodmist planes outside of Last Crest, the herbalist is a character that we encountered during our first excursion to deal with the cultists. She has been very kind and useful to us and frequently looks after our pet Roc, Rocksanne. She makes really good potions as well.

The herbalist was first indicated as lead in our serach for the cultists. We found her in a troll cave where we finished off the last of 4 trolls that she was fighting. She turned out to be the adoptive mother of Walneak (blue haired dude) and the alchemist dude Blondie. Yes, Blondie is actually his name.

She was also involved in teleporting us to the small farming village plagued by a herd of Bulletts, where we first encountered Gorick. 

After Aurora and Eraphina died, the Herbalist sent us on a quest to retrieve some red Mandrake before should would give us information about resurrecting them.
