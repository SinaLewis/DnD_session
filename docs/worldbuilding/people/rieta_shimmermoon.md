## Reita Starag Shimmermoon

Rieta was born on the 19th day of Ches (Spring Equinox) to human parents. At first she looked as a human babe would. But as she grew certain features started to become apparent. First her black hair developed a peculiar purple sheen. Not unlike a raven's wing. Although not common in humans it wasn't too out of the ordinary. And her parents assumed it to be the result of a distant ancestors genetics making themselves known. They didn't know how right and yet wrong they were

When Rieta was about 3 years of age it became apparent that this distant ancestor wasn't human. Her eyes had become a solid silver, she had the beginnings of horns and a tail. No, this ancestor wasn't human. They were a tiefling and the blood had made itself known in Rieta. Her parents loved her dearly despite being the unexpected parent's of a so called devilspawn. After all, she was a sweet child and was the only child the couple had been blessed with. But they knew that as Rieta grew, and her devilish traits became harder to conceal, that the townspeople and their superstitions would make her life very difficult and eventually drive her from the village.

They knew that the best chance Rieta laid in the nearby forest. A kindly Fey was said to occasionally visit a glade that had a large grey stone in the center. For several years they visited this glade on the solstices and equinoxes. Auspicious days for encounters with the fey folk. On Rieta's 7th birthday their waiting bore fruit. They beseeched the Fey to take Rieta back to the Feywild with them. Away from the harsh treatment she could expect on her home plane. Teach her what they could about the powers inherent in her blood and teach her how to do good with them. The Fey agreed, for a price...

And so Rieta grew up in the Feywild, adopting the name of her Fey protector alongside that of her human parents.

After dying and being revived by a dragon heart, Rieta gained scales and the ability to breath a radiant light from her mouth.
